## Description of Project
I wanted to make something that relates to my current work. The video linked above should show a lot of the information as far as the code is concerned, but here I can walk you through some of the thought processes and timeline. 

### First Step: Make the floorplan
I was inspired by a test page of an interactive floorplan for a mall that I had seen some while ago. While I had the images, I needed to draw them on the page so as to be able to access each of the individual parts. Using a coordinate system, I was able to completely draw the 1st level floorplan. From there, it became figuring out the specific interactions, css, and javascript to make it do some of the things I was imagining. 

### Second Step: Tinkering
I spent a lot of time figuring out the was to make a reservation system (commented out in the bottom of the code), but wasn't quite getting it to the point that I was happy with, so decided to focus on other interactive elements. This is where I came up with the idea of having the directions show up and a click feature that provided the information. I was able to pull from a lot of our past tinkers and personal projects to incorporate and adapt multiple elements into this singular project.

### Third Step: Reset!
Probably the last part of the project was with having a way to reset the path. I tried many things before settling on an array and a for loop (which I had intended to use at an earlier part but had some problems). It was nice to figure out how to incorporate that at a different part and I'll definitely go back to try to clean up the drawPath() section. Right now, both my HTML and Javascript files are semi-long, and I know there are ways of making it more efficient, but I was more concerned with making all of the elements work. 

#### Thanks for taking a look at my project. I learned a lot while making it and am excited to keep building it out to what I imagined and hopefully find a use in the future.
